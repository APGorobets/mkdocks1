Dashboards

General is the main page that will be displayed by default when you open Zebrunner.
 (Could it be changed for smth else?) 
By default, it accumulates 4 widgets - 30 days total, 30 days pass rate by platform, 30 days test details, and 30 days tests trend.
Later on, all the other added widgets would also be displayed there (?).

The upper bar of the window holds several icons with the actions that could be performed with the dashboard and its widgets:


Sending the dashboard by email
Widget placement / resizing / rearrangement
Dashboard editing
Adding new widget to the dashboard

To send the current dashboard via email:
Click on the arrow icon in the upper-right corner of the window:



“Name” and “Text” fields are filled by default, the text is changeable. Fill in the “Recipients” field (unlimited number of emails per time), and press the “Send” button.
Pop-up message “Email was successfully sent” would appear in the lower-right corner of the window.
