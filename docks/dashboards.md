## Dashboards

  General is the main page that will be displayed by default when you open Zebrunner.
By default, it accumulates 4 widgets - 30 days total, 30 days pass rate by platform, 30 days test details, and 30 days tests trend.
Later on, all the other added widgets would also be displayed there:

The upper bar of the window holds several icons with the actions that could be performed with the dashboard and its widgets:

* Sending the dashboard by email
* Widget placement / resizing / rearrangement
* Dashboard editing
* Adding new widget to the dashboard

###### To send the current dashboard via email:
1. Click on the arrow icon in the upper-right corner of the window:

In this mode, the size of all widgets can be changed (the arrows at every corner of the widget - the same principle as system windows):
